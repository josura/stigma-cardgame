# STIGMA
stigma is a role game inspired by lupus in tabula and other deduction games with elements of horror and surrealism.

The cards descriptions are written in italian but can be swapped since the cards are customizable

## ROLES
Most of the roles have some counterpart in the original lupus in tabula (with expanded database of roles), but some of them were created
### BASIC
- Human (***Villager*** but with additional modifiers) represented by a human silhouette
- Chaos breeder (***Werewolf*** but with additional features) represented by a blank card 
- Observer (***Fortune teller*** or ***seer***) represented by an eye
### DINAMIC
- Scapegoat (***misunderstood***), officially a villager, becomes a scapegoat during the first day, the MASTER is the one that chose one of the villager to be a scapegoat, the scapegoat itself doesn't know he is the scapegoat 
### EXTENDED
- Accelerationist (), guesses all of the Chaos breeders after the first consultation of the game(at the start before the expansion phase) or later. if the guess is correct at the end of the game and the Chaos breeders are winning, the accelerationist wins if the number after a dice roll is greater than (turn\_of\_guess x 2 - 1) (first turn guess will be a number greater than 1, second turn greater than 3, third turn only the number 6). The accelerationist is a normal Human after the guess or the third turn.
